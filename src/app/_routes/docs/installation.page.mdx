import Pagination from "@/components/features/docs/molecules/pagination";

# Installation

Nindo is distributed as a [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) style registry component. This means you get a single, self-contained file that you can customize to your needs.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Nindo, ensure you have:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) configured
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) configured
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) recommended

## Setup 

```bash title="Terminal"
npx shadcn-ui@latest add https://nindo.rasengan.dev/registry/markdown-editor.json
```

This command will:
- Download the `markdown-editor.tsx` file
- Download required `shadcn ui` components like `button` and `card`.
- Place them all in your `components/ui` directory
- Install required dependencies such as [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown), [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev), [react-syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter), [@rasenganjs/theme](https://rasengan.dev/packages/theme) and others


## Usage

```tsx showLineNumbers title="Markdown Editor"
import { MarkdownEditor } from '@/components/ui/markdown-editor';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-8">
      <MarkdownEditor />
    </div>
  );
}
```

<MarkdownEditor className="h-[500px]" />

If you see the editor with toolbar and preview, you're good to go! 🎉

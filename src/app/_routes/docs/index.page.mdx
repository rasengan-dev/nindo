# Introduction

Nindo is a modern, extensible Markdown editor built with React. Inspired by Medium, Notion, and Obsidian, it provides a seamless writing experience with live preview, keyboard shortcuts, and a powerful block-based architecture.

## Why Nindo?

- **Markdown-First**: Write in plain text, see rich results in real-time
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, maximum performance
- **Extensible**: Plugin system for custom functionality
- **Customizable**: Full theming support with Tailwind CSS
- **Production-Ready**: Built for real-world blogging platforms and CMSs
- **Keyboard-First**: Extensive shortcuts for power users

## Key Features

### Live Preview
Real-time markdown rendering powered by `@rasenganjs/mdx`, displayed side-by-side with your editor.
You can use another tool to preview markdown, it's opt to you.

### Block-Based Architecture
Every line of markdown is parsed into a block (heading, paragraph, code, quote, list), enabling context-aware toolbars and smart operations.

### Smart Shortcuts
Type `#` + `Space` for headings, `-` + `Space` for lists, and more. Auto-pairing for brackets, quotes, and markdown syntax.

### Extensible Toolbar
Easily add custom formatting actions, from simple text transformations to complex block operations.

## Use Cases

- **Blog Platforms**: Full-featured post editor with auto-save
- **Documentation Sites**: Technical writing with code syntax highlighting
- **Note-Taking Apps**: Personal knowledge management systems
- **CMS Integration**: Headless CMS markdown editor
- **Collaborative Tools**: Real-time collaborative editing (with extensions)

## Philosophy

Nindo follows a **textarea-first approach** instead of contentEditable, providing:
- Predictable cursor behavior across browsers
- Simple state management
- Native undo/redo support
- Easy integration with any React application
